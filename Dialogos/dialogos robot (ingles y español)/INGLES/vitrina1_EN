This is a model of the UX1-Neo submarine Robot. The original is about 60 cm in diameter. This robot is capable of exploring flooded mines, making 3D maps and is equipped with several geophysical sensors that allow geologists to know the raw materials indside the mine. The UX1 is the result of the collaboration between CAR and several European institutions. Here we have developed the control and autonomous navigation systems.
