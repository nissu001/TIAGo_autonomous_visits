This is the Intelligent Control group, whose main objectives are based on the application of artificial intelligence techniques to ensure, on the one hand, the safe navigation of vehicles and robots and, on the other hand, an advanced interaction of systems with humans, known as HRI or Human-Robot Interaction.

The group develops innovative contributions in fuzzy control, combinatorial optimization, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping or SLAM, and much more. 
We also use deep learning techniques, natural language processing, connected devices and IoT, object and human recognition, sensory fusion, and so on.

Indoor mobile robots can perform a large number of functions. The group has extensive experience in the development of systems for guided tours at fairs and museums, in inspection, search and rescue and, with special emphasis in recent years, in assistive robotics for the elderly and for health-related purposes.

In addition to myself, other robots work in this group. There is a base like mine, but without body, arms and head, for projects and tests dedicated only to navigation without interaction. There are also assistive robots like Potato, designed entirely in the laboratory, conceived as an aid to people and equipped with a robotic emotional system. 
I would also like to mention some older robots such as Blacky, Urbano, which was very famous for years and appeared a lot on TV and in the press, the Pioneer 3At, and the Doris robot, used in several recent projects.

If you have any questions we will be happy to answer them.
