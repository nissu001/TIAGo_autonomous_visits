This is a model of the UX1-Neo submarine robot, whose original size is about 60 cm in diameter. 

This robot is capable of exploring flooded mines, making 3D maps, and is equipped with several geophysical sensors that allow geologists to know the raw materials inside the mine. 

The UX1 is the result of the collaboration between CAR and several European institutions.
