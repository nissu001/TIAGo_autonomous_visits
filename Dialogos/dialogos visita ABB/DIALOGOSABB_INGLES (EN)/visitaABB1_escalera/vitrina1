On your right is the practice laboratory, where several practical sessions for different subjects are held throughout the year.
It consists of eight workstations, each one equipped with physical systems, such as a QUBE2 servo, a generator and a process simulator; with data acquisition equipment, such as P C I e cards, USB cards and programmable logic controllers; with instrumentation, such as power supplies and signal generators; and also with a UR3e collaborative robot.
On your left youâ€™ll find a model of the UX1-Neo submarine robot, whose original size is about 60 cm in diameter. 
This robot is capable of exploring flooded mines, making 3D maps, and is equipped with several geophysical sensors that allow geologists to know the raw materials inside the mine. 
The UX1 is the result of the collaboration between CAR and several European institutions.
