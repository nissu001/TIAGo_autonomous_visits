This is the Research Group on “Computer Vision and Aerial Robotics” at CAR-UPM, whose activities are oriented to two main objectives.
The first is UAV autonomous complex missions using on board sensors, that is , Vision and Lidar; and on-board computing for autonomously flying in environments where GPS is not available, for example indoors; or where GPS doesn't provide enough accuracy, for example industrial inspection and/or manoeuvres close to obstacles.  
We have our own open source framework for operating autonomous our missions at www.aerostack.org.
Our second main objective is Autonomous image and video recognition and detection using Machine Learning, for example DL, as well as Image Processing techniques, mainly used for aerial images an also for other kind of images. Reinforcement Learning for controlling UAV is also one of our main research topics, based on both direct visual info and pose estimation. 
We also love to participate in top International Competitions in drone autonomy, where we’ve obtain relevant awards, such as IMAV12, IMAV13, IARC14, IMAV16, IMAV17, General Chair for IMAV 2019, coordinator of the international team awarded with the third place at the Grand Challenge MBZIRC20, as well as RAMI-IROS22, ICUAS 22, IMAV 22 and ICUAS23.
A Sample of some recent projects are “SHEREC: Safe, Healthy and Environmental Ship Recycling”, European Project under Program HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01- ; “COPILOT: Photovoltaic Power Plant Inspection”, R&D projects funded by Madrid Government in close coloration with local companies ; “AEROGENIA: Inspection of Windmills”, funded by the Spanish Ministry under the program Public-Private Collaboration ; “RATEC: Localization and planning of aerial and ground robots for inspection and maintenance tasks”, funded by Spanish Ministry under the program “Prove of Concept” ; “MINERVA: Environmental Risk Assessment Through Visual Assessment" , Private funding by company ARQUIMEA ; "DAR Project for Aircraft Inspection” for AIRBUS Defence & Space ; and “Boiler Inspection in Meirama Thermal Power Plant” for Naturgy.
Here we highlight some recent remarkable projects. If you are interested, please ask for further information about these projects or others.
